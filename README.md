# wai-aria-inspection
A Django app to improve ARIA and other accessibility standards understanding
## about
This app is created for my better understanding of accessibility web standards in general and comparing the use of ARIA with the concept of not using it in applications.
This work is planned to be as course and later a diploma work.
## Plan
1. Read enough information about accessibility standards for revising info that I already know.
2. Write a small Django app demonstrating good and bad examples of ARIA use.
3. Include automated tests written with BDD methodology/test app with existing automated accessibility checkers for checking results.
4. Write a document illustrating all learned info/written app for presenting the work to university.
This work may help as a future job of QA tester/web developer.
